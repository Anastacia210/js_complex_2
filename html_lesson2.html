<p>Bruce Dickinson went to audition for Iron Maiden at a rehearsal room in Hackney in September 1981 and immediately
    discovered that this was a much more professional operation than he was used to with Samson. In the practice rooms,
    the band played through "Prowler", "Sanctuary", "Running Free" and "Remember Tomorrow", before asking Dickinson to
    sing the same songs again in a recording studio, and he was immediately inducted into the group.</p>

<p>Iron Maiden had a strict and organised routine that suited the band's writing style, which Dickinson described as a
    "time table". After a few gigs, they began writing new material for their third album, The Number of the Beast,
    released in 1982. In the wake of Samson's contractual problems, Dickinson could not legally be credited on any of
    the record's songs, having to make, what he called, a "moral contribution", later revealing that he had contributed
    to "The Prisoner", "Children of the Damned" and "Run to the Hills". In the documentary 12 Wasted Years, manager Rod
    Smallwood refers to "The Prisoner" as being co-written by Dickinson and Adrian Smith. The album was a major success,
    topping the British charts, and earning platinum status in the UK and the US. Following the release, the band
    embarked on a supporting tour around the globe.</p>

<p>On the following albums, 1983's Piece of Mind and 1984's Powerslave, Steve Harris's song-writing monopoly was pushed
    aside in favour of other members' ideas, with Dickinson contributing to a number of tracks, including the singles
    "Flight of Icarus" and "2 Minutes to Midnight". Throughout the World Slavery Tour, as part of the new theatrical
    elements incorporated into the band's stage-show, Dickinson wore a feathered mask during "Powerslave". This was the
    band's longest tour to date, during which Dickinson considered going home mid-tour, due to the high number of shows.
    Iron Maiden's management were continually adding dates, until Dickinson demanded that they stop or he would leave
    the group.</p>
