<h1>E-TYPE</h1>
<p>Bo Martin Erik Erikson (born 27 August 1965), better known by his stage name E-Type, is a Swedish eurodance musician, songwriter and record producer. His professional name is based on the Jaguar E-Type sports car.</p>

<h2>Vocalists</h2>
<p>The music of E-Type follows the typical Eurodance formula of synthesizer music built up to a dance floor crescendo, accompanied by his own vocals, and a chorus sung by Nana Hedin (who appeared in the music videos for "Set the World on Fire", "Paradise" and the 2009 re-release of "Life"). Hedin provided vocals for more than half of all E-Type's songs. She made her last appearance on record with E-Type on his 2004 album Loud Pipes Save Lives. In 2009 she was told by doctors that she has cancer in her tongue and she is therefore currently not performing. E-Type's 2007 album, Eurotopia, featured his new vocalist, Sanne Karlsson.
    Much of E-Type's success in the 1990s was built on dancer Dilnarin "Dee" Demirbag, who lip-synched to Hedin's vocals in several of E-Type's music videos such as "This is the Way", "Calling Your Name", "Angels Crying", "Here I Go Again" and "Life", and appearances on TV shows and concerts. "Dee" left the band in 2001 to pursue a solo career. However, she got back together with E-Type in December 2006 for a concert in Russia, and is still touring with the band occasionally. She also appeared in the 2007 music video for "True Believer"</p>
